CUWIC Workshop: Personal Website Party!

## Never Built a Website Before?
That's what this repo is here for! The goal of this codebase is to allow you to build a site from scratch using HMTL, CSS, and Javascript, as well as share the basics about how to get your site up and running. 

## How to Use This Repository
Note: this is not a guided workshop. It's a resource that you can fork from Github that allows to you start with a template and  mix and match elements that you want to include on your site. So basically, this repo has the key files for a basic site, and acts as a library for useful code snippets for personal websites. 

**Key Components**

- `index.html`: main page for every site -- the home page
- `code-templates`: if you want to create a new page or add elements to your site, this folder contains useful code snippets to add to your working site.
- `pages`: holds files for other pages on your website aside from your home page (i.e. about me, projects, etc)
- `resources`: storing media/files that you'd like to display on your site (images, pdf of your resume, etc)
- `scripts`: Javascript files (or other scripting files)
- `styles`: stylesheets (i.e. CSS files)

## Viewing Your Site Locally
You can open your website locally by just opening your HTML files in a browser. That usually means you can double click on the file in File Explorer/Finder; however, if that isn't working, you may need to right click on the file and open it in a specific browser. Every time you make a change, save your .html file, and then refresh the browser.

## Hosting Your Site on the Internet
To make your website accessible from the internet, you need to host it somewhere. Traditionally, people would puchase a URL and then setup a physical server to serve their website's contents to visitors. In light of cloud computing, we can now avoid doing this and just host our website with the help of a hosting provider. 

There are lots of hosting methods, however; not all of them are free. I recommend using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) if you have a Github account, as they give you access to a URL for free. Other good options include Google Firebase, AWS, and Biz.nf.

Want a custom URL? Check out [Namecheap](https://nc.me/), who gives one free URL per student!
